# crown-clothing

This will be a fully realized clothing web application using React along with CRA, Firebase, Stripe, and a few other tool kits and libraries. I will update this readme every once in a while as this project continues to progress. 

09/05/2023 update: I've set up firebase and have successfully completed two(2) sign-in methods (i.e. Google pop-up and email/password). More updates to follow.
